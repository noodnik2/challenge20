# Sample Volumes

The "external volume" folders here are used for demonstration purposes.

In a more realistic scenario, a network filesystem could be used to enable
wider, shared access to the files (such as from an FTP and/or web server.)

- [inbox](inbox)
- [outbox](outbox)

You'll see these folders mounted as "external volumes" to the Docker
container in the provided [run script](../bin/run-db.sh).
