Instructions For Running
------------------------

The standard run procedure requires Python 3; e.g.:

    $ python3 run_tests "python c3p_runner.py"

The program was developed with Python version 3.8.2, though it is believed that it
should run properly on any version of Python 3.

The unit tests are a helpful starting place for understanding or diagnosing
problem(s) which may arise, and can be run with:

    $ python3 c3p_scorer_tests.py
    $ python3 c3p_grader_tests.py


Design
------

The problem seemed pretty straightforward, given the detailed description provided
(in README.md) of the scoring and grading criteria.  The implementation was likewise
broken into modules for scoring and grading, in files 'c3p_scorer.py' and 'c3p_grader.py'.
Unit tests for each module were added to help establish confidence in the correctness
of expected behavior for additional cases.
